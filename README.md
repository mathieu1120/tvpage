# tvpage

Develop a web app that given an url, will give insight to what domains that web page is linking. In addition to the start url a link depth can be specified. In that case all pages within link depth distance should be part of the analysis.
 
Requirements:
- Use a (probably) free cloud platform to host the app or run locally and send instructions on how to run. 
- As a bar minimum the result should:
  - list all domains
  - per domain have a drop down with the list of url in that domain.
  - some graphic charts, for example a histogram.
  - a responsive design:  background processing while having a functional web page.  Or request can be queued; submitting a query while investigating a previous result.
Additional features:
- Add a mechanism to identify returning users and show them a history of searches.
 
To be delivered:
- fair estimation of the number of hours spend.
  - the url to a working web site.
  - all code behind it, both static and dynamic contents, in a comprehensible way.
  - short document describing:
     - functionality with pointers to the code; document should introduce code base, not replicate what can be read in the code itself.
     - status of work:
        - finished
        - todo list
        - suggestions for improvements
Additional deliverable:
  - suggestions how to test the web site
  - unit tests for the code
 
The project will be reviewed in how good you present the project as work in progress:
  - better have less but working and understandable functionality and leave the rest of your vision in the document.
  - not having the bare minimum working does not mean failure, as long as the minimum is well described in the document.
